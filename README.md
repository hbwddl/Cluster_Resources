Presentation and scripts for students who are just beginning to use the RSPH cluster. These materials were originally created in 2024 for an Epidemiology PhD student journal club.

To use these notes, begin with completing the steps in the "Cluster Prep" document, then work through the presentation. The cluster documentation is also included in the "HPC Getting Started Guide".
